    <p>Yam porridge or Asaro is another delicious Nigerian yam dish cooked in a well-seasoned pepper mix until soft and fluffy with some yam chunks. It is very quick and easy to make. It makes a perfect dinner or lunch and it is also a party favourite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A tuber of yam (about 1kg)</li>
        <li>Red bell pepper (Tatashe)</li>
        <li>Scotch bonnet chillies (Ata Rodo)</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Palm oil (use according to preference and you can substitute with vegetable oil)</li>
        <li>Beef Seasoning powder or stock cubes</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Mackerel fish, cleaned (substitute with dry fish or smoked fish)</li>
        <li>Beef stock (optional) as you can also use water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>peel and cut yam into chunks</li>
        <li>Roughly blend red bell pepper, scotch bonnet chill and onions together on a pulse and set aside</li>
        <li>Boil fish for about 5 minutes with seasoning, salt. Save fish broth for the porridge if you are not using beef stock</li>
        <li>Place a small pan on medium heat, add palm oil and heat for about 2 minutes. Add chopped onions and fry till onions are translucent. Take it off the heat and set aside. This is to be added to the yam at the tail end of the cooking.</li>
        <li>De-bone fish, flake and set aside</li>
        <li>Place a pan on medium heat; add yam chunks, blended pepper mixture and enough water to cover it (about one cm above the yam or keep it at the same level), add salt and bring to boil till yam is almost tender. Reduce the heat if you have to avoid the yam burning</li>
        <li>Add stock or water to yam in between cooking if need be</li>
        <li>Once yam is almost tender add already heated palm oil and chopped onions to the yam and continue to cook till yam is tender</li>
        <li>Add seasoning (maggi/knorr) to your taste and check for salt</li>
        <li>Using a wooden ladle, break yam into pieces but not to puree, leave some yam chunks if you desire</li>
        <li>Add stock or water to yam in between cooking if need be (only do this to achieve desired thickness)</li>
        <li>Add flaked fish and stir together gently to avoid breaking the fish and yam more, cook for another 2-3 minutes</li>
        <li>Finally, add chopped spinach (or any other green vegetable), fold into porridge and cook for another 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with sides of choice.</li>
    </ol>
